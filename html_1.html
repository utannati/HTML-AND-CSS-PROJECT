<h1>Animals</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;>Animals are a major group of organisms, classified as the kingdom Animalia or Metazoa. In general they are multicellular, capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment, and feed by consuming other organisms</span>.<br>-Note:   The above text is excerpted from the Wikipedia article "Animal", which has been released under the GNU Free Documentation License</p>
<p>Animals dominate human conceptions of life on Earth not simply by their size,&nbsp;abundance, and sheer diversity but also by their mobility, a trait that humans share.</p>
